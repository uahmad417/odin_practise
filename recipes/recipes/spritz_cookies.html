    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <img src="../images/sptriz_cookies/step1.webp" alt="step1" height="310">
        <li>Beat butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl for 30 seconds. </li>
        <img src="../images/sptriz_cookies/step2.webp" alt="step2" height="310">
        <li>Add sugar, baking powder, and salt. Beat until combined, scraping sides of bowl occasionally. Beat in egg, vanilla, and almond extract until combined. </li>
        <img src="../images/sptriz_cookies/step3.webp" alt="step3" height="310">
        <li>Beat in as much of the flour as you can using the mixer. Stir in any remaining flour with a wooden spoon</li>
        <img src="../images/sptriz_cookies/step4.webp" alt="step4" height="310">
        <li>Force room-temperature dough through a cookie press onto ungreased cookie sheets. If desired, sprinkle cookies with colored sugar or nonpareils. </li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are firm but not brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
        <img src="../images/sptriz_cookies/step6.webp" alt="step6" height="310">
        <li>For powdered sugar icing, combine powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla in a small bowl. If necessary, add more milk, 1 teaspoon at a time, to make icing drizzling consistency.</li>

        <li>If desired, drizzle cooled cookies with powdered sugar icing and decorate with sprinkles.</li>
