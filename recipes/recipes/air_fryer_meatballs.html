    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        After trying air fryer meatballs, I will never bake them in the oven again. 
        The insides stay nice and tender while the outsides get a slight crisp on them. 
        The best part is that you can make them ahead of time and freeze for later use. 
        I have included those directions in the notes. Dip meatballs in marinara, if desired.

        Your air fryer is the secret to perfect meatballs that are crispy on the outside,
        but tender and juicy on the inside. You’ll come back to this air fryer meatball recipe again and again.
